Getting and Cleaning Data Project Codebook 
Descritpion
The TidySet data contains 180 rows and 73 columns which consist of the mean and standard deviation (Std) of the measurements collected.  
The base data is grouped by the following variables to build mean and the standard deviation. 
subjectId: identifies the subject activityId: correlates to the activity performed when measurements were collected. 
Activity: 30 Subjects were numbered from 1 to 30 and their activty were listed as the following: 
1. WALKING. 
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS. 
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS. 
4. SITTING. 
5. STANDING. 
6. LAYING. 
Measurements 
The measurements collected include the mean and std of readouts collected from a smartphone located on each participant's waist. 
The features in columns 3-73 are selected from a larger data set of 561 columns, the features selected as directed in the project outline are:
